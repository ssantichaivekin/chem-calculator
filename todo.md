This is my to do list.

- Create a list of constants that should be defined like plank constant, the ideal gas constant, or moles. (We look this up in our chem modules / textbook appendix).
- The function `m()` should support `Na2B4O7.10 H2O` maybe also `Na2B4O7+10H2O`.
- Create `showwork()` method.
- Integrate it to the terminal for it to run well. / Automation / ipythonrc
- Enable the mass command to scrape the web for mass information.
- Create lab objects like breaker. They can have properties like 'molar' and methods like pour_to().
- How about a 'react()' method?
- Rewrite README.md

Done

- Define a function mass mode that change each element's value to its mass.
- Define a function mass('name') which calculate the mass of such name. > mass('C6H12O6')
- Make that function support parenthesis--use recursion?
- Create MORE test cases for both functions.
