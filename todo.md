This is my to do list.

1. Define a function mass mode that change each element's value to its mass. +
2. Define a function mass('name') which calculate the mass of such name. > mass('C6H12O6') +
3. Make that function support parenthesis--use recursion? +
4. Create test cases for both functions. (maybe do this first.) +
5. Create a list of constants that should be defined like plank constant, the ideal gas constant, or moles.
6. Integrate it to the terminal for it to run well. / Automation / ipythonrc
7. Enable the mass command to scrape the web for mass information.
8. Create lab objects like breaker. They can have properties like 'molar' and methods like pour_to().
