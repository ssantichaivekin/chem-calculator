- build via binder.
- Create `showwork()/hidework()` method. It should show what websites it obtain its datas from, or how it gets calculated.

This will most probably not get done. I don't think I will revisit this soon :

- Perform chemical equation balancing and redox calculations.
- Create lab objects like breaker. They can have properties like 'molar' and methods like pour_to().
- Perform units calculations.
- How about a 'react()' method?
- Maybe elements, compounds, etc deserves its own class.

Done

- Define a function mass mode that change each element's value to its mass.
- Define a function mass('name') which calculate the mass of such name. > mass('C6H12O6')
- Make that function support parenthesis--use recursion?
- Create MORE test cases for both functions.
- Create a new matcher class.
- The function `m()` should support `Na2B4O7.10 H2O` maybe also `Na2B4O7+10H2O`.
- Create a list of constants that should be defined like plank constant, the ideal gas constant, or moles.
- Integrate it to the terminal for it to run well. (I did it by adding alias ichem='ipython -i ~/location/chem-calculator/chem_calculator.py in my .zshrc)
- Enable the mass command to scrape the web for mass information.
- Grab thermodynamic datas from wikipedia.
- - Create a new README.md with screenshots of how to use it in chem lab.
