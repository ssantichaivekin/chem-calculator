This is my to do list.


- Enable the mass command to scrape the web for mass information.
- Integrate it to the terminal for it to run well. / Automation / zshrc / ipythonrc / ipython -i script.py (we do this by moving all scraping constants to ~/chem_calculator/constants_csv/)
- Write a constant scraper.
- We can also grab thermodynamic datas from wikipedia.
- Create `showwork()` method.
- Create lab objects like breaker. They can have properties like 'molar' and methods like pour_to().
- How about a 'react()' method?
- Rewrite README.md
- Maybe elements, compounds, etc deserves its own class.

Done

- Define a function mass mode that change each element's value to its mass.
- Define a function mass('name') which calculate the mass of such name. > mass('C6H12O6')
- Make that function support parenthesis--use recursion?
- Create MORE test cases for both functions.
- Create a new matcher class.
- The function `m()` should support `Na2B4O7.10 H2O` maybe also `Na2B4O7+10H2O`.
- Create a list of constants that should be defined like plank constant, the ideal gas constant, or moles.
