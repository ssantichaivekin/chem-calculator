# chemcalculator

This is a Python helper function designed to be used with interactive python. It takes advantage of Python's `global()` to set element and constant to the global scope (for example,. We can then use such constants for easy calculations.

I am also looking towards to take advantage of Mac's `automation` and Python's `ipythonrc`. To help initialize the script.

I am also thinking about using Python's magic method for something pretty cool. Let's see how it goes.

I will also add web scraping to the ipython code to scrape chemistry properties from elements. I feel like the program also deserve its own version of `whos`.
